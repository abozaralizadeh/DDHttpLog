#HttpLogMonitoring
Simple Python console app to read http log files and produce statistics and alerts.

```
using apt-get on Ubuntu:

```
* the csv file should be passed as the last argument
### Run the tests

```

## How to improve

* Dockerize the app to make it portable and easy to use
* Use a pubsub messaging queue to buffer the live log and handing it to different services 
(statistics, alerting, etc.) to make the application more modular
and scalable.
* Use parallel workers (like celery workers with the chosen technology stack) 
as the consumers of the log stream (statistics, alerting, etc.) 
to provide segregation of duties and modularity.
* Use a time series database (such as influxdb) as the destination of calculated
alerts or aggregated statistic to provide better options for post analysis
instead of the printing results in standard io.
